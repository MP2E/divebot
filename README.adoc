= divebot: a simple Haskell IRC Bot

Based off of https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot[Roll your own IRC bot],
this project is simply for fun, and to get a stronger grasp of Monad Transformers and sequencing
IO effects. I'd also like to use QuickCheck to prove properties, and migrate over to Text and use
criterion to benchmark the difference(learning those in the process, as well)

== Planned features
- Markov bot
- set of useful commands for channel/bot management
- watch git repos and report on commits
- simple Haskell evaluator?
